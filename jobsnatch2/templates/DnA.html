            <h3>Data scientists turn raw data into meaningful information that organisations can use to improve their businesses.</h3>
              <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
                <h3>As a data scientist, you'll need to:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>work closely with your business to identify issues and use data to propose solutions for effective decision making</li>
                    <li>build algorithms and design experiments to merge, manage, interrogate and extract data to supply tailored reports to colleagues, customers or the wider organisation</li>
                    <li>use machine learning tools and statistical techniques to produce solutions to problems</li>
                    <li>test data mining models to select the most appropriate ones for use on a project</li>
                    <li>maintain clear and coherent communication, both verbal and written, to understand data needs and report results</li>
                    <li>create clear reports that tell compelling stories about how customers or clients work with the business</li>
                    <li>assess the effectiveness of data sources and data-gathering techniques and improve data collection methods</li>
                    <li>horizon scan to stay up to date with the latest technology, techniques and methods</li>
                    <li>conduct research from which you'll develop prototypes and proof of concepts</li>
                    <li>look for opportunities to use insights/datasets/code/models across other functions in the organisation (for example in the HR and marketing departments)</li>
                    <li>stay curious and enthusiastic about using algorithms to solve problems and enthuse others to see the benefit of your work.</li>       
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="b" style="height:45%;width: 50%;line-height: 1.6; float:left;background-color:#0a0909dc;color:white;margin-top:1%;margin-left:2%;border-radius:5px;padding-left:7px;padding-right:7px;">
           <h2 style="text-align:center;">Qualifications</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">You'll typically need a degree in a computer science, mathematical or science-based subject to work as a data scientist. The following degree subjects may be particularly useful:
                <ul>
                    <li>computer science</li>
                    <li>data science/computer and data science</li>
                    <li>engineering</li>
                    <li>mathematics</li>
                    <li>mathematics and operational research</li>
                    <li>physics</li>
                    <li>statistics.</li>
                </ul>
                You'll be expected to know some programming languages such as R, Python, SQL, C or Java and have strong database design and coding skills.
                Some large employers offer data science graduate training schemes, which tend to take around two years to complete. Some schemes will accept graduates from any discipline. Others will specify the degree subjects they will accept.

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Skills</h2>
             <p style="text-align:justify;">
                You'll need to have:
                <ul>
                <li>excellent analytical and problem-solving skills</li>
                <li>experience in database interrogation and analysis tools, such as Hadoop, SQL and SAS</li>
                <li>exceptional communication and presentation skills in order to explain your work to people who don't understand the mechanics behind data analysis</li>
                <li>effective listening skills in order to understand the requirements of the business</li>
                <li>drive and the resilience to try new ideas if the first one doesn't work - you'll be expected to work with minimal supervision, so it's important that you're able to motivate yourself</li>
                <li>planning, time management and organisational skills</li>
                <li>the ability to deliver under pressure and to tight deadlines</li>
                <li>great attention to detail</li>
                <li>teamworking skills and a collaborative approach to sharing ideas and finding solutions.</li>

         <div id="d" style="height:45%;width: 50%;line-height: 1.6; float:left;background-color:#ffffffb5;margin-top:1%;margin-left:2%;border-radius:5px;padding-left:7px;padding-right:7px;">
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Work experience</h2>
             <p style="text-align:justify;">Internships are available in data science at a number of the bigger employers, particularly in finance, retail and travel.
                 You could also approach small to medium-sized enterprises for internship or shadowing opportunities.
                 Most internships or placements are advertised in the autumn. However, with smaller organisations you may need to make targeted speculative applications to find out about opportunities.
                 Online data science competitions, such as those hosted by Kaggle and Topcoder, are used by employers to spot new and emerging talent. Also, look out for events and conferences that you can 
                 attend as these can help you gain knowledge and offer great networking opportunities that may lead to employment.
                 Talk with your university careers service for advice on where to search for internships and placements locally.
                 Find out more about the different kinds of work experience and internships that are available.

         <div id="e" style="height:45%;width: 45%;line-height: 1.6; float:right;background-color:#0a0909dc;color:white;margin-top:1%;margin-right:2%;border-radius:5px;padding-left:7px;padding-right:7px;">
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Career prospects</h2>
             <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Progress will depend on your ability to quickly learn the relevant skills needed to analyse large data sets, as well as your commitment to the organisation you're working for.
                You can be promoted to more senior data science roles within your company, which may involve line management of junior data scientists.
                Promotion from junior to senior data scientist can take between two to five years. After five years you'll be expected to take on more people management responsibility.
                The skills you acquire are transferable across a range of sectors so it can be relatively easy to move into different companies.  
                An alternative pathway is to join a start-up company and work on projects outsourced by larger organisations.              
                You'll also find opportunities to move into a research career.

                <h2 style="text-align:center;">Working hours</h2>
                 <p style="text-align:justify;"> Depending on the type of company you work for, you can expect a good work/life balance. Core office hours are typically between 8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday. 
                    There may be times, particularly on short-term projects, where working outside of core office hours or at weekends is necessary.
                    In some organisations you may have the opportunity to work remotely or on a flexible schedule.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align:center;">What to expect</h2>
                 <p style="text-align:justify;"> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data science is a collaborative area, with many people sharing their methodologies and insights, so you should be prepared to share your ideas and solutions with your wider team.</li>
                        <li>Jobs are available in towns and cities throughout the UK with companies in a large range of sectors. There are also opportunities to work overseas.</li>
                        <li>Roles are usually office-based, and a large proportion of your time will be spent at your desk. You'll be encouraged to learn as much about the business as you can to help identify solutions to problems.</li>
