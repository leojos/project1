            <p  style="font-weight: bold;">Aptitude tells about the mental stability and analytical skills of an individual. Someone who doesn't have the right skills for a position, or who isn't a good fit with the corporate culture, often ends up being replaced.
             Then companies fill the position again, and turnover costs and lost opportunities become significant. To make better hiring decisions and avoid high job turnover rates, national & multi-national organizations use aptitude & ability testing.
             Companies also use these tests for promoting and training. The goal is to get the right people, with the right skills, in the right jobs.</p>
